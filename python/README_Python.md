# 2. Python Data Transformation

### 📘 Objective
Transform the raw dataset (`sql_test-raw`) into the final pivot table (`sql_output-expected.xlsx`),  
matching the format of the **sql_test-expected** sheet.

Metrics calculated:
1. **Profit** = `sales_amt – sales_cost`
2. **Sales Qty Contribution by Category** = `sales_qty / total monthly sales_qty (by category)`
3. **Sales Amt Contribution by Category** = `sales_amt / total monthly sales_amt (by category)`
4. **Sales Cost Contribution by Category** = `sales_amt / total monthly sales_cost (by category)`
5. **Profit Contribution by Category** = `profit / total monthly profit (by category)`

### 🧱 Setup Instructions

1. Open **Jupyter Notebook** (via Anaconda, VS Code, or terminal).  
2. Ensure **Python 3.10+** is installed.  
3. Install dependencies using the following command
   *(run this in your **terminal**, not inside Jupyter)*:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl jupyter
4. Place the file (`excel_sample_data_de.xlsx`) in the same working directory as your notebook.
5. Open the notebook file named **[Data Transformation (Python).ipynb](python/Data%20Transformation%20(Python).ipynb)**

### ▶️ How to Run in Jupyter

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook from your environment.
2. Open [Data Transformation (Python).ipynb](python/Data%20Transformation%20(Python).ipynb).
3. Run all cells sequentially:
  Click Run All, or
  Press Shift + Enter for each cell.

The final file (`sql_output-expected (Python).xlsx`) will be generated in the same folder.

### **Note on Metric Display Format**

In the reference Excel file (`sql_test-expected`), contribution metrics are displayed as percentages (e.g., **45%**).  
In this Python output, the same values are represented in decimal form (e.g., **0.45**) to preserve numeric precision during calculations.  
Both formats are equivalent which only the display format differs.
